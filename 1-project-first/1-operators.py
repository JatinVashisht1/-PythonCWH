a = 3
b = 4
print("The value of 3+4 is ", 3+4)# + is an arithmetic operator
a = 45
c = 66 # = is assignment operator
a += c # += is also an assignment operator it means a = a + c
print(a)
d = c/a
print(d)
print(c//a) # // is returns quotient
print(66//45)

#comparison operators return boolean
print(c==d) # == is comparison operator
print(c<d)
print(c>d)

# Logical Operators operates on Boolean values
print(c<a and c>d)# and is Logical operator
